# tic-tac-toe

This is another part of the Odin Project.
This project in particular focused on modular programming.

I understand this concept but still struggled to put it in practice, but this project has definitely helped me out.

I originally made 9 separate functions for each of the 9 buttons for the tic-tac-toe game.
Every time I wanted to change something regarding the functionality of the buttons, I had to change it on all 9 separate functions.

I was able to change it so there was only one function that applied to all of the buttons.
It cut the number of lines of code in half and definitely helped teach me the power of modular coding.
